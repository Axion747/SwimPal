*****SwimPal******
This is a personal project of mine. As a current manager and member of a swim team, it has always been a pain to record times on a clipboard and sheet of paper
near a pool of swimmers. The constant pain of not being able to record times due to the paper being too wet and too many people crowding around to check their times. 


Introducing the SwimPal, a digital alternative to the traditional paper recording methods. Comes with a built in meet sheet, point counter, timer, and roster. 
Simply create a team, insert swimmer names, and start any meet without the hassle of wet paper!
